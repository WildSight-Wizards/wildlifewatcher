**Issue**: The users should be able to see where the cameras are placed all over the worlds on a real-time map so they can select a camera on the map to see its details, add cameras to their favourites or see the list of species captured by a camera.

**Decision**: We need to store spatial data (geometric data, coordinates) as attribute values for cameras and places where species have been found.

**Constraints**: None

**Implications**: The attribute values contains informtion such as latitude and longitude relationships to cameras, location of species found around planet but also location descriptors that includes information about cities, staets, countries and so on

**Group**: Infrastructure

**Positions**: N/A

**Argument**: Having this data will allow for easy visualization of cameras and allow scientists to extract data on contiguos regions and investigate spatial patterns
