For our initial release, we have identified quite a lot of infrastructure to be created.

As this is a charity, it is unknown how the human factor will work in this project (the exact upkeep, maintenance, etc).

Due to this, we have identified some useful functionality which we feell should be parked for a v2:

- The use of Digital Twins
- Uploading footage to the application for later analysis/viewing
