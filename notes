Meeting Fri 17/11

Assumptions:
Cameras should be connected to lorawan via a separate hardware component

Discussions:
Camera sends captures only of images or frames it is not sure about
Camera sends messages for animals it spots if it is confident is an animal it knows
Camera sends frames batches rather than video streaming

Push notifications from the web app. Users should be able to subscribe to push notifications for any spottings, cameras, tagging requests

iNaturalist integration may need to be correlated with the other automated tagging system. A workflow or hierarchy of tagging systems. The assumption here is that iNaturalist is more manual whereas the other tagging facilities are automated, larger ML models.
Taggers Hierarchy to be defined with external taggers only when needed if the internal systems dont work

Observation service subscribes to messages for clear observations. Decision is that the Camera will send the image associated with a motion trigger regardless of whether it can tag an animal or not.

Identify ilities from Requirements

Identify performance levels, metrics based on Requirements

Video Storyline

External Tagging System wildlife.ai community through the web app allow users to tag like iNaturalist
